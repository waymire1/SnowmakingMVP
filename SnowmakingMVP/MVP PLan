### **MVP Development Plan**

#### **1. Define Core Functionalities for the MVP**

To keep the project scope manageable, focus on these essential features:

1. **Weather Data Aggregation and Processing**
   - Collect real-time weather data from one reliable API.
   - Calculate key metrics like wet-bulb temperature.
   - Display the data in a user-friendly interface.

2. **Interactive Map with Basic Features**
   - Implement an interactive map of the ski area.
   - Show snowgun locations and statuses.
   - Allow users to select runs or trails.

3. **Snowgun Control Simulation**
   - Simulate snowgun operations (since hardware integration is complex).
   - Provide controls to adjust settings and visualize outcomes.

4. **User Interface**
   - Develop a simple UI with essential screens:
     - Dashboard for data overview.
     - Map view for interaction.
     - Control panel for snowgun settings.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Development Plan**

##### **Phase 1: Set Up the Development Environment**

- Install Node.js and npm.
- Set up Git and create a GitHub repository.
- Initialize your project with `create-react-app` for the frontend and set up the backend with Express.js.

##### **Phase 2: Implement Weather Data Aggregation**

- **Choose a Weather API:**
  - Use [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) for reliable data.
  - Register and obtain an API key.

- **Backend Development:**
  - Create an Express.js server.
  - Develop an endpoint to fetch weather data.
  - Implement wet-bulb temperature calculation.
  - Store data in a database if necessary.

- **Test API Calls:**
  - Ensure you can successfully fetch and process data.

##### **Phase 3: Build the User Interface**

- **Design the Layout:**
  - Sketch wireframes for the dashboard and map view.
  - Keep the design simple and functional.

- **Develop the Dashboard:**
  - Use React.js to build components.
  - Display weather data and calculated metrics.

- **Integrate the Map:**
  - Incorporate Leaflet.js into your React app.
  - Display the ski area map.
  - Add markers for snowgun locations.

##### **Phase 4: Simulate Snowgun Control**

- **Create the Control Panel:**
  - Develop UI components for snowgun settings.
  - Use sliders and input fields for adjustments.

- **Backend Simulation:**
  - Mock snowgun responses based on user inputs.
  - Update the UI to reflect changes.

##### **Phase 5: Enable Run/Trail Selection**

- **Map Interaction:**
  - Add interactivity to the map for selecting runs/trails.
  - Highlight selected areas and display relevant information.

- **Link to Control Panel:**
  - Allow users to plan snowmaking activities for selected runs.

##### **Phase 6: Testing and Refinement**

- **Functional Testing:**
  - Manually test each feature.
  - Fix bugs and improve performance.

- **User Feedback:**
  - Gather feedback from peers or potential users.

##### **Phase 7: Deployment**

- **Local Deployment:**
  - Ensure the app runs smoothly on your local machine.

- **Optional Cloud Deployment:**
  - Deploy the app using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for broader accessibility.
