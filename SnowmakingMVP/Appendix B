# Appendix B: Data Flow Diagrams

This appendix provides detailed Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) illustrating how data moves through the snowmaking software system. The DFDs are organized into different levels to represent the system's complexity at various granularities, from the context-level overview to more detailed breakdowns.

## B.1 Introduction to Data Flow Diagrams

Data Flow Diagrams are a graphical representation of the flow of data through an information system. They show how data is processed by the system in terms of inputs and outputs. The diagrams are structured in levels:

- **Level 0 (Context Diagram):** Provides a high-level overview of the entire system, showing the system boundaries, external entities that interact with the system, and major data flows.
- **Level 1:** Breaks down the main processes of the system into sub-processes, showing more detail.
- **Level 2 and Beyond:** Further decomposes the processes into more detailed sub-processes as needed.

## B.2 Notation Key

Before diving into the diagrams, it's essential to understand the symbols used:

- **External Entity:** Represented by a square or rectangle. Entities outside the system that interact with it (e.g., Users, Weather APIs).
- **Process:** Represented by a circle or rounded rectangle. Functions or activities that transform data.
- **Data Store:** Represented by an open-ended rectangle or two parallel lines. Places where data is stored (e.g., Databases).
- **Data Flow:** Represented by arrows. Indicates the direction of data movement between entities, processes, and data stores.

## B.9 Data Flow Scenarios

### B.9.1 Normal Operation Scenario

1. **Weather Data Update**
   - System fetches new weather data every 15 minutes.
   - Processes and stores data in the Operational Database.
2. **User Adjusts Snowgun Settings**
   - User inputs new settings via the User Interface.
   - System validates inputs and updates snowgun configurations.
3. **Snowgun Adjustment**
   - Commands are sent to snowguns.
   - Snowguns adjust operations and send back status updates.

### B.9.2 Error Handling Scenario

1. **Data Fetch Failure**
   - If the system fails to fetch data from a Weather API, it logs the error and retries.
   - Falls back to alternative data sources if necessary.
2. **Snowgun Communication Failure**
   - If a snowgun does not acknowledge a command, the system alerts the user.
   - Attempts to resend the command or suggests manual intervention.

## B.10 Conclusion

These Data Flow Diagrams provide a comprehensive view of how data moves through the snowmaking software system. By understanding these flows, developers and stakeholders can better comprehend the system's functionality, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure that all components work together seamlessly.
